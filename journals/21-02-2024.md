# ✏️ Journal for 21-02-2024

## 📝 What i did today
I improved the history tab a little and the tab system is cleaner. It is now easier to navigate between tabs.

## 📈Ideas
I don't have any new feature to add right now. Maybe more tabs to help writing code inside of the Journal.

## 📝TODO
- Add the customisation of every parameter that needs to be customisable (see list)
- Add customisation to tabs. Make it so that you can change the order and and add a new tab easly.
