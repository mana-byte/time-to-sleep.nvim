## 📝 What I did today
I made the emote menu or rather the emote tab. It works kinda flawlessly and i'm really happy with how it turned out.

## 📈 What needs to be improved
- Configuration of emotes and keymap for the emote tab.
- Add a new tab for help
- Add a new tab text styles (writting code or making something bold)
- Add a new tab for Ideas of what to write ex:
    - What i learned
    - What i did today
    - Improvements
    - What i want to do tomorrow
    - ...
   those will be titles that can be added to the b   buffer.

I good day of programming ! 😎
