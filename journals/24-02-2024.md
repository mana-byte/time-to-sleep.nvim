## 📄 What i did today
Finished the config file. The plugin is now very customisable and will need more tabs in the future to keep up with the amount of customisation that is possible.
Fortunatly the addition of tabs is now much easier than before so the only thing to find is ideas of new tabs

## 📑 TODO
- Make the readme and the doc.
