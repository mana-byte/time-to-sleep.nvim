# 📒 What i did today
I cleared the code because it was really unreadable and i made some improvements to the stability of the journal UI.

# ✏️ TODO
-I discovered i new bug that makes the UI crash and unrecoverable (it has something to do with playing like a mad man with the tabs)

# What i learned today
OOP with lua is really bizzare compared to languages like java but it works really well and is really stylish !
I think I need to understand it a bit more though it is still quite blury in my head.
