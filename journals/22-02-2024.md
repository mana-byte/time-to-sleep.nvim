# Journal for 22-02-2024

## ✏️ What i did today
Made the config a bit more customisable but it is still not enough because a lot of things are still left unclear.

## 📜 TODO
- Finish the config.lua
- Issue with the history tab where on a new month it won't cork because you just do days-1 and nothing else
